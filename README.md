# Project Questions
### Employee Directory Application (MERN Applcation)
The objective of this project is to create a full-stack web application that utilizes MongoDB as the database,
Express.js as the backend framework, React.js for the frontend, and Mongoose as the MongoDB object
modelling tool. The application will serve as an employee directory, allowing users to view all employees
and filter them by department.

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing employee data.
- Express.js: A Node.js framework for building the backend API.
- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Mongoose: An ORM library for MongoDB and Node.js.

**Back-end Development**

1. Setting Up the Backend
- Initialize the backend project.
- Install necessary dependencies: express, mongoose, cors.
2. Database Setup
- Set up a MongoDB database to store employee data.
3. Employee Model
- Create a Mongoose model for the employee schema.
- Define fields name, surname, gender, department, and salary.
4. API Routes
- Create routes to handle CRUD operations for employees.
- Implement endpoints to:
  
▪ Get all employees.

▪ Get employees by department.
▪ Add a new employee.

▪ Update an existing employee.

▪ Delete an employee.

5. Server Setup
- Set up an Express server to listen for incoming requests.
- Connect the server to the MongoDB database.

**Front-end Development**

1. Setting Up the Frontend
- Initialize the frontend project.
- Install necessary dependencies: react, react-router-dom, axios.
2. Routing Setup
- Implement routing using React Router v6.
- Create routes for Home, Employees, and Employees by Department pages.
3. Components
- Create functional components for each page: Home, Employees, and Department.
- Implement fetching employee data from the backend using Axios.
- Display employee data in tables.
4. Styling
- Apply basic CSS styling to enhance the UI.
- Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI if necessary.

### Contact Manager (MERN Application)

You are asked to design and implement a Contact Manager application that allows users to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve their personal or professional contacts.
The goal is to create a simple but functional system that demonstrates your ability to work with databases and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

**Requirements**

1. Core Features:

- Add new contacts with essential details such as Name, Phone Number, and Email Address.

- Edit an existing contact’s information.

- Delete a contact from the database.

- List all saved contacts in a clean, readable format.

2. Technical Expectations:

- Use a database to persist contact information.

- Ensure data validation.

- Provide a simple and user-friendly UI or command-line interface for managing contacts.

- Handle errors gracefully (e.g., when trying to edit or delete a non-existent contact).
