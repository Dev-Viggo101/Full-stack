# Project Questions
### Employee Directory Application (React.js, Express.js, and MongoDB Applcation)
The objective of this project is to create a full-stack web application that utilizes MongoDB as the database,
Express.js as the backend framework, React.js for the frontend, and Mongoose as the MongoDB object
modelling tool. The application will serve as an employee directory, allowing users to view all employees
and filter them by department.

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing employee data.
- Express.js: A Node.js framework for building the backend API.
